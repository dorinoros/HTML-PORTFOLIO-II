    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello.<br/>
      My name is Dorin. I am 33 years old originally from Romania, but living in the UK for the past 10 odd years.
      Form a young age I was passionate about computers, numbers and the English language. I have a bachelors degree in Finance and Accounting and been working in the finance department of a wholesale insurance broker, mainly dealing with accounts receivables.

    <p>Lately I was feeling that I would like to get my hands into new areas, keep my mind busy and acquiring new skill sets. Got inspiration from my mother, who got enrolled in a pastry chef course, and my sister as well who got a huge interest in IT, web developing in particular. This made me start this new journey into web developing to see if I like it enough as to swap careers.</p>
    <p>I got enrolled in a complete web developing course by Dr Angela Yu and this website is part of the Portfolio Project and I am very excited to see the final look of the website. </p>
